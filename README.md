# AWS 2-Tier Static Hosting

This project demonstrates a **2-Tier Static Web Hosting Architecture on AWS**, designed for scalability, security, and high availability.  

It uses services like **VPC, EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, RDS, Route 53, CloudFront, ACM, and WAF** to deliver a secure static web application.

## üìå Architecture Overview
- **Amazon Route 53** routes user requests.  
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** distributes traffic across **EC2 instances**.  
- **Auto Scaling Group** ensures high availability and fault tolerance.  
- **Amazon RDS** in private subnets provides the database layer.  
- **CloudFront + ACM (SSL/TLS)** secures communication with HTTPS.  
- **AWS WAF** enhances security against common attacks.
